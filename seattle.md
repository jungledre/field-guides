### Fremont + Ballard

* Golden Gardens — definitely a trek but you can catch a bus (61) there and it’s a great place to spend an evening. Man made white sand beach and firepits.

* **OBLIGATORY DINNER**  >>>** Dine at Joule **<<< Where we spend way too much $$ on small plates and fancy ass cocktails.

Ravenna

* There are a bunch of pocket parks around Ballard. One has a cement couch and another one has a giant chess board.

* Kerry Park (a little out of the way and up the hill from the bus stop but there’s an incredible view… maybe we can get one of my friends to drive us there.)

* Discovery Park — 

* Magnuson park - go to the dog park even if you don't have a dog. great for full day adventure times

### Other places of note:

    * Absolutely requires a car and to really enjoy it, I’d give the park 3/4 days

* The Cascades

    * An hour drive will get you into some crazy mountains

* Mt Rainier

    * Possible to do this as a day trip go hang out on the lumpiest of mountains!

    * I really enjoyed the 6mile hike in and out of Glacier Basin. Snow all year though.. but you can still do it in sneakers if you really want to :p
